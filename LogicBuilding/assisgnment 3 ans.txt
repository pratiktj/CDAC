question 1:
The loop runs infinitely because the loop control variable i is being decremented (i--) instead of incremented (i++). This means that i will always be less than 10, causing the loop to never terminate.

solution is increment i instead of decrement

question 2:
The loop does not execute as expected because the condition in the while loop is using the assignment operator (=) instead of the equality operator (==). The assignment operator assigns the value 0 to count, which is always false in a boolean context, causing the loop to never execute.

To fix this, we should use the equality operator (==) in the while loop condition

question 3:
The loop only executes once because of the condition in the do-while loop. Here’s a detailed explanation:

Explanation
Initial Value: num starts at 0.
Do-While Loop: The do block executes first, printing 0 and then incrementing num to 1.
Condition Check: After the do block executes, the while condition num > 0 is checked. Since num is now 1, the condition is true, and the loop continues.
Second Iteration: The do block executes again, printing 1 and then incrementing num to 2.
Condition Check: The while condition num > 0 is checked again. Since num is now 2, the condition is true, and the loop continues.
This process will continue indefinitely because num will always be greater than 0 after the first iteration

solution is:If you want the loop to execute only once, you should change the condition to num == 0:

question 4:
The issue with the loop boundaries is that the condition i <= 10 includes the number 10 in the output. If the task expects the loop to print numbers from 1 to 9, you need to adjust the loop condition to exclude 10.

To meet the expected output of printing numbers from 1 to 9, you should change the loop condition to i < 10:

question 5:
The loop does not print numbers in the expected order because the update statement i++ increments the loop control variable i, while the condition i >= 0 suggests that the loop should be decrementing i. This mismatch causes the loop to run infinitely, as i will always be greater than or equal to 0.

Explanation
Initialization: i starts at 10.
Condition: The loop continues as long as i is greater than or equal to 0.
Update: i is incremented (i++), which means i will keep increasing, never meeting the condition to terminate the loop.

To print numbers from 10 down to 0, i should decrement i in the update statement:

question 6:
The issue is that the for loop only includes the System.out.println(i); statement because it is not enclosed in braces {}. As a result, the System.out.println("Done"); statement is outside the loop and executes only once after the loop completes.
To include both System.out.println(i); and System.out.println("Done"); within the loop, you should enclose the loop body in braces {}:

question 7:
The code produces a compilation error because the variable count is declared but not initialized. In Java, local variables must be initialized before they are used. The while loop condition count < 10 tries to use count before it has been assigned a value, leading to a compilation error.
To fix this, you need to initialize the count variable before using it in the while loop

question 8:
The loop prints unexpected numbers because the num variable is being decremented (num--) instead of incremented (num++). This causes the loop to terminate after the first iteration since num becomes 0, which is not greater than 0.
To print the numbers from 1 to 5, you should increment num in the do block and adjust the loop condition accordingly:

question 9:
The loop does not run infinitely, but it might print unexpected results if you were expecting a different sequence. The update expression i += 2 increments i by 2 in each iteration, which means the loop will print every second number starting from 0 until i is no longer less than 5.
If you want the loop to print numbers from 0 to 4 incrementing by 1, you should change the update expression to i++:

question 10:
The issue with your loop condition is that you are using the assignment operator = instead of the equality operator ==. In Java, = assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left, and the result of the assignment is the value assigned. Therefore, num = 10 always evaluates to 10, which is a non-zero value and considered true in the context of the while loop. This causes the loop to execute indefinitely.
However, if you want the loop to decrement num until it is no longer 10, you should adjust the condition to something like while (num > 0)

question 12:
The variable x causes a compilation error because it is declared inside the for loop, making its scope limited to the loop block. In Java, a variable declared inside a block (enclosed by {}) is only accessible within that block. Once the block is exited, the variable is no longer accessible.

question 1
1. Perform Dry Run
We’ll manually trace the code execution:

Outer Loop (i = 1):
Inner Loop (j = 1): Prints 1 1 
Inner Loop (j = 2): Prints 1 2 
End of inner loop, prints a newline.
Outer Loop (i = 2):
Inner Loop (j = 1): Prints 2 1 
Inner Loop (j = 2): Prints 2 2 
End of inner loop, prints a newline.
Outer Loop (i = 3):
Inner Loop (j = 1): Prints 3 1 
Inner Loop (j = 2): Prints 3 2 
End of inner loop, prints a newline.
2. Observations
The outer loop runs from i = 1 to i = 3.
For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs from j = 1 to j = 2.
The inner loop prints the current values of i and j followed by a space.
After the inner loop completes, a newline is printed.
3. Guess the Output
Based on the dry run and observations, the output will be:

1 1 1 2 
2 1 2 2 
3 1 3 2 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
question 2
Perform Dry Run
We’ll manually trace the code execution:

Initial State: total = 0
First Iteration (i = 5):
total += 5 → total = 5
i != 3, so total -= 1 → total = 4
Second Iteration (i = 4):
total += 4 → total = 8
i != 3, so total -= 1 → total = 7
Third Iteration (i = 3):
total += 3 → total = 10
i == 3, so continue is executed, skipping total -= 1
Fourth Iteration (i = 2):
total += 2 → total = 12
i != 3, so total -= 1 → total = 11
Fifth Iteration (i = 1):
total += 1 → total = 12
i != 3, so total -= 1 → total = 11
2. Observations
The loop starts with i = 5 and decrements i by 1 each iteration until i > 0.
For each iteration, total is incremented by the value of i.
If i equals 3, the continue statement skips the total -= 1 operation for that iteration.
For all other values of i, total is decremented by 1 after being incremented.
3. Guess the Output
Based on the dry run and observations, the final value of total after the loop completes will be 11.

So, the output of the program will be:11

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
question 3:
1. Perform Dry Run
We’ll manually trace the code execution:

Initial State: count = 0
First Iteration:
count < 5 is true.
Print count (0), so output is 0 .
Increment count → count = 1.
count != 3, so continue.
Second Iteration:
count < 5 is true.
Print count (1), so output is 0 1 .
Increment count → count = 2.
count != 3, so continue.
Third Iteration:
count < 5 is true.
Print count (2), so output is 0 1 2 .
Increment count → count = 3.
count == 3, so break is executed.
After the Loop:
Print count (3), so output is 0 1 2 3.
2. Observations
The while loop runs as long as count is less than 5.
The loop prints the value of count and then increments it.
When count reaches 3, the break statement terminates the loop.
After the loop, the final value of count is printed.
3. Guess the Output
Based on the dry run and observations, the output will be:0 1 2 3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
question 4
1. Perform Dry Run
We’ll manually trace the code execution:

Initial State: i = 1
First Iteration:
Print i (1), so output is 1 .
Increment i → i = 2.
Check condition i < 5 (true), continue loop.
Second Iteration:
Print i (2), so output is 1 2 .
Increment i → i = 3.
Check condition i < 5 (true), continue loop.
Third Iteration:
Print i (3), so output is 1 2 3 .
Increment i → i = 4.
Check condition i < 5 (true), continue loop.
Fourth Iteration:
Print i (4), so output is 1 2 3 4 .
Increment i → i = 5.
Check condition i < 5 (false), exit loop.
After the Loop:
Print i (5), so output is 1 2 3 4 5.
2. Observations
The do-while loop executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition.
The loop prints the value of i and then increments it.
The loop continues as long as i is less than 5.
After exiting the loop, the final value of i is printed.
3. Guess the Output
Based on the dry run and observations, the output will be:1 2 3 4 5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
question 6
. Perform Dry Run
We’ll manually trace the code execution:

Initial State: x = 5
First Operation: ++x
Pre-increment: x is incremented before use.
x becomes 6.
Second Operation: x--
Post-decrement: x is used before decrement.
x is 6 (used in the expression).
x becomes 5 after the operation.
Third Operation: --x
Pre-decrement: x is decremented before use.
x becomes 4.
Fourth Operation: x++
Post-increment: x is used before increment.
x is 4 (used in the expression).
x becomes 5 after the operation.
Now, substitute these values into the expression for y:

y = 6 - 6 + 4 + 4Perform Dry Run
We’ll manually trace the code execution:

Initial State: count = 0
First Iteration (i = 0):
i++: Post-increment, i is used as 0 and then incremented to 1.
++i: Pre-increment, i is incremented to 2 before use.
count += 0 - 2 → count = -2
End of iteration, i is 2.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
i++: Post-increment, i is used as 2 and then incremented to 3.
++i: Pre-increment, i is incremented to 4 before use.
count += 2 - 4 → count = -4
End of iteration, i is 4.
Third Iteration (i = 4):
The loop condition i < 4 is false, so the loop terminates.
2. Observations
The loop runs while i is less than 4.
In each iteration, i++ uses the current value of i and then increments it.
++i increments i before using it.
The expression i++ - ++i results in a subtraction that affects the count variable.
The loop terminates when i reaches 4.
3. Guess the Output
Based on the dry run and observations, the value of count will be:

count = -2 + (-2) = -4

So, the output of the program will be:

2. Observations
The pre-increment (++x) and pre-decrement (--x) operations change the value of x before it is used in the expression.
The post-increment (x++) and post-decrement (x--) operations use the current value of x in the expression before changing it.
The final value of x after all operations is 5.
3. Guess the Output
Based on the dry run and observations, the value of y will be:8
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
question 7
1. Perform Dry Run
We’ll manually trace the code execution:

Initial State: a = 10, b = 5
First Operation: ++a
Pre-increment: a is incremented before use.
a becomes 11.
Second Operation: b--
Post-decrement: b is used before decrement.
b is 5 (used in the expression).
b becomes 4 after the operation.
Third Operation: --a
Pre-decrement: a is decremented before use.
a becomes 10.
Fourth Operation: b++
Post-increment: b is used before increment.
b is 4 (used in the expression).
b becomes 5 after the operation.
Now, substitute these values into the expression for result:

result = 11 * 5 - 10 + 4

2. Observations
The pre-increment (++a) and pre-decrement (--a) operations change the value of a before it is used in the expression.
The post-increment (b++) and post-decrement (b--) operations use the current value of b in the expression before changing it.
The final values of a and b after all operations are 10 and 5, respectively.
3. Guess the Output
Based on the dry run and observations, the value of result will be:

result = 11 * 5 - 10 + 4 = 55 - 10 + 4 = 49

So, the output of the program will be:49

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
question 8
Perform Dry Run
We’ll manually trace the code execution:

Initial State: count = 0
First Iteration (i = 0):
i++: Post-increment, i is used as 0 and then incremented to 1.
++i: Pre-increment, i is incremented to 2 before use.
count += 0 - 2 → count = -2
End of iteration, i is 2.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
i++: Post-increment, i is used as 2 and then incremented to 3.
++i: Pre-increment, i is incremented to 4 before use.
count += 2 - 4 → count = -4
End of iteration, i is 4.
Third Iteration (i = 4):
The loop condition i < 4 is false, so the loop terminates.
2. Observations
The loop runs while i is less than 4.
In each iteration, i++ uses the current value of i and then increments it.
++i increments i before using it.
The expression i++ - ++i results in a subtraction that affects the count variable.
The loop terminates when i reaches 4.
3. Guess the Output
Based on the dry run and observations, the value of count will be:

count = -2 + (-2) = -4

So, the output of the program will be:-4
